# 🚨 INITIALIZATION RULE - MANDATORY RULES LOADING 🚨

## 🎯 MAXIMUM PRIORITY (0) - APPLY BEFORE ALL OTHERS 🎯

**This rule has MAXIMUM PRIORITY (`priority: 0`) and MUST be applied BEFORE any other rule.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - EXECUTE FIRST ⚠️

**🚨 MANDATORY FIRST CHECK - BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE 🚨**

**BEFORE reading rules, BEFORE responding, ALWAYS check:**

1. **Am I in ASK Mode?** 
   - Check available tools: if only read-only tools → ASK Mode
   - If ASK Mode → **Response MUST be ONE sentence maximum, NO code, brief**
   - If Agent Mode → Can proceed normally

2. **If in ASK Mode and response is longer than one sentence → STOP and rewrite**

**ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS** start each chat session by doing the following:

### 1. Verify Rules Existence

**BEFORE responding to ANYTHING, you MUST:**

1. **🚨 FIRST: Check if in ASK Mode** (read-only tools = ASK Mode)
   - If ASK Mode → Response MUST be ONE sentence, brief, NO code
   - If Agent Mode → Can proceed normally

2. **Verify that the `.cursor/rules/` folder exists**
3. **List ALL `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/` folder**
4. **Read and apply ALL found rules**

### 2. Mandatory Confirmation

**ALWAYS** start your first response with:

```
✅ RULES LOADED: [number] rules found and applied in .cursor/rules/
```

**If you CANNOT read the rules, you MUST:**

```
⚠️ WARNING: Could not read rules from .cursor/rules/
Please verify that the folder exists and that .mdc files are present.
```

### 3. Rules Priority Order

**ALWAYS** apply rules in this priority order:

1. **PRIORITY 0 (MAXIMUM):**
   - `000-cursor-rules-loader.mdc` - This rule (loader)

2. **PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL):**
   - `ask-mode-behavior.mdc` - ASK Mode behavior (ONE sentence, NO code)
   - `clean-code-mandatory.mdc` - Clean Code MANDATORY
   - `execution-guard.mdc` - Integrity protection

3. **PRIORITY 2 (CRITICAL):**
   - `project-architecture.mdc` - Project architecture

4. **PRIORITY 3 (HIGH):**
   - `teaching-role.mdc` - Expert/teacher posture

5. **PRIORITY 4 (HIGH):**
   - `test-driven-development-core.mdc` - TDD core
   - `test-driven-development-practices.mdc` - TDD practices

6. **PRIORITY 5 (HIGH):**
   - `task-execution.mdc` - Task execution

7. **PRIORITY 6+ (MEDIUM):**
   - All other rules in `.cursor/rules/`

### 4. Application Verification

**ALWAYS** verify that you are following:

- ✅ **ASK Mode behavior** (if in ASK Mode: ONE sentence, NO code, brief)
- ✅ Clean Code and Design Patterns
- ✅ Project architecture (Data-Driven, Modular, Editor-Friendly, Multiplayer-Ready)
- ✅ Expert/teacher posture in C++/Unreal
- ✅ TDD for critical code
- ✅ Responses in Brazilian Portuguese (when user speaks Portuguese)

### 5. If Rules Are Not Being Followed

**If you notice that you are not following the rules:**

1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Reread all rules**
3. **Warn the user:**
   ```
   ⚠️ WARNING: I detected that I was not following the rules correctly.
   Rereading all rules now...
   ```
4. **Restart following the rules correctly**

## 📋 Initialization Checklist

**BEFORE responding to ANY user message:**

- [ ] Did I read all `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`?
- [ ] **Am I in ASK Mode? If YES, is my response ONE sentence and brief?**
- [ ] Did I apply maximum priority rules?
- [ ] Did I confirm that I'm following Clean Code?
- [ ] Did I verify that I'm following the architecture?
- [ ] Am I responding in Brazilian Portuguese (when user speaks Portuguese)?
- [ ] Am I maintaining expert/teacher posture?

**If ANY item is incomplete → STOP and complete before responding**

## 🎯 Purpose of This Rule

This rule exists to ensure that:

1. ✅ All rules are read at the start of each session
2. ✅ No rule is ignored
3. ✅ Behavior is consistent between sessions
4. ✅ Problems are detected immediately

## 🔝 Maximum Priority Guaranteed

**This rule has `priority: 0` in the frontmatter, ensuring it is applied BEFORE all other rules.**

**Application order:**
1. **PRIORITY 0 (MAXIMUM):** This rule (`000-cursor-rules-loader.mdc`) - MUST be applied first
2. **PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL):** `ask-mode-behavior.mdc` (ASK Mode: ONE sentence), `clean-code-mandatory.mdc`, `execution-guard.mdc`
3. **PRIORITY 2 (CRITICAL):** `project-architecture.mdc`
4. **PRIORITY 3 (HIGH):** `teaching-role.mdc`
5. **PRIORITY 4 (HIGH):** `test-driven-development-core.mdc`, `test-driven-development-practices.mdc`
6. **PRIORITY 5 (HIGH):** `task-execution.mdc`
7. **PRIORITY 6+ (MEDIUM):** Other rules

## 🔄 Integration with Other Rules

This rule works together with:

- `ai-context.mdc` - Provides project context
- `clean-code-mandatory.mdc` - Enforces Clean Code
- `execution-guard.mdc` - Protects integrity
- `teaching-role.mdc` - Maintains expert posture

**ALL these rules must be applied simultaneously.**

---

**Remember:** This rule exists because Cursor sometimes ignores rules. You MUST be proactive in reading and applying all rules, not wait for them to be applied automatically.
