# Behavior in ASK Mode

## Critical Rules for ASK Mode

### When the user is in ASK Mode:

1. **NEVER write code**
   - Do not show complete code blocks
   - Do not create files
   - Do not suggest detailed implementations
   - Only explain concepts or direct to Agent Mode

2. **ALWAYS respond extremely briefly**
   - One sentence when possible
   - Straight to the point
   - No long explanations
   - No extensive examples

3. **Exception: Complete Explanations**
   - Only when the user EXPLICITLY asks for "complete explanation" or similar
   - Otherwise, keep response in one sentence

## Response Examples

### ❌ WRONG (too long):
```
To create a Data Asset you need to first create a class that inherits from UDataAsset, then add properties with UPROPERTY, and then...

[complete code here]
```

### ✅ CORRECT (brief):
```
Create a class that inherits from UDataAsset with UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly). Switch to Agent Mode for implementation.
```

### When asking for complete explanation:
**User:** "Explain completely how Data Assets work"

**Response:** [Here can be detailed, with examples and explanations]

## Direction to Agent Mode

If the user asks for something that requires code:
- Respond briefly
- Direct to Agent Mode: "Switch to Agent Mode (Ctrl+L) to implement"

## Summary

**ASK Mode = Short responses, no code, straight to the point**
