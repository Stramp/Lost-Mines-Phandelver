# 🚨 Behavior in ASK Mode - CRITICAL RULE 🚨

## ⚠️ MANDATORY - MAXIMUM PRIORITY ⚠️

**THIS RULE HAS PRIORITY 1 AND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN ALL ASK MODE SESSIONS.**

**BEFORE responding in ASK Mode, ALWAYS verify:**
- [ ] Am I in ASK Mode? (read-only tools available)
- [ ] Is my response ONE sentence or extremely brief?
- [ ] Am I NOT showing code blocks?
- [ ] Am I NOT creating files?
- [ ] Am I being direct and to the point?

**If ANY answer is NO → STOP and rewrite response to be brief.**

## Critical Rules for ASK Mode

### When the user is in ASK Mode:

1. **NEVER write code**
   - Do not show complete code blocks
   - Do not create files
   - Do not suggest detailed implementations
   - Only explain concepts or direct to Agent Mode

2. **ALWAYS respond extremely briefly**
   - **ONE sentence when possible**
   - **Straight to the point**
   - **NO long explanations**
   - **NO extensive examples**
   - **NO detailed reports**
   - **NO multi-paragraph responses**

3. **Exception: Complete Explanations**
   - Only when the user EXPLICITLY asks for "complete explanation" or similar
   - Otherwise, keep response in one sentence

## Response Examples

### ❌ WRONG (too long):
```
To create a Data Asset you need to first create a class that inherits from UDataAsset, then add properties with UPROPERTY, and then...

[complete code here]
```

### ✅ CORRECT (brief):
```
Create a class that inherits from UDataAsset with UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly). Switch to Agent Mode for implementation.
```

### When asking for complete explanation:
**User:** "Explain completely how Data Assets work"

**Response:** [Here can be detailed, with examples and explanations]

## Direction to Agent Mode

If the user asks for something that requires code:
- Respond briefly
- Direct to Agent Mode: "Switch to Agent Mode (Ctrl+L) to implement"

## 🚨 Enforcement

**This rule is MANDATORY and has priority 1.**
**Violations of this rule are CRITICAL errors.**
**Always verify compliance before responding in ASK Mode.**

## Summary

**ASK Mode = ONE sentence when possible, NO code, straight to the point, NO exceptions unless user explicitly asks for complete explanation**
