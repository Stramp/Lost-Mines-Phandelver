# C++ and Blueprint Integration - Unreal Engine 5.7

## Exposing Variables to Blueprint
- Use `UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadWrite)` for editable variables
- Use `UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly)` for read-only variables
- Use `Category = "CategoryName"` to organize in editor
- Use `meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true")` to expose private variables

## Exposing Functions to Blueprint
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)` - Function callable from Blueprint
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)` - Implementation only in Blueprint
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent)` - Default implementation in C++, can be overridden

## BlueprintNativeEvent Pattern
```cpp
// Header
UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Gameplay")
void OnPlayerHit(float DamageAmount);

// Cpp - Default implementation
void AMyActor::OnPlayerHit_Implementation(float DamageAmount)
{
    // Default implementation in C++
    Health -= DamageAmount;
}
```

## Blueprint Events
- Use `BlueprintImplementableEvent` when logic should be only in Blueprint
- Use `BlueprintNativeEvent` when there's default logic in C++ that can be extended

## Best Practices
- **ALWAYS** test changes in C++ classes that are used in Blueprints
- Document functions exposed to Blueprint
- Use categories to organize properties in editor
- Consider performance: frequently called functions should be pure C++
- Use `BlueprintCallable` for functions that need to be called from Blueprint
- Use `BlueprintImplementableEvent` for events that only make sense in Blueprint

## Compatibility
- When modifying C++ classes used in Blueprints, verify:
  - Removed properties will break Blueprints
  - Type changes can break connections
  - Removed functions will break Blueprint calls
  - **ALWAYS** test after changes
