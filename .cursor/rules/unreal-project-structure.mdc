# Unreal Engine 5.7 Project Structure

## Project Context
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.7
- **Platform**: Windows (Win64)
- **Languages**: C++, Blueprints
- **Editor**: Cursor/VS Code
- **Build System**: UnrealBuildTool (UBT)

## Directory Structure
- `Source/MyProject2/` - Main C++ source code module
- `Source/MyProject2.Target.cs` - Game build configuration
- `Source/MyProject2Editor.Target.cs` - Editor build configuration
- `Content/` - Game assets (Blueprints, Textures, Models, etc.)
- `Config/` - Configuration files (.ini)
- `Binaries/` - Compiled executables (don't version)
- `Intermediate/` - Temporary build files (don't version)
- `Saved/` - Editor generated files (don't version)
- `DerivedDataCache/` - Derived data cache (don't version)

## Build and Compilation
- Use UnrealBuildTool (UBT) to compile
- Available configurations: Debug, DebugGame, Development, Test, Shipping
- **ALWAYS** verify project compiles before suggesting changes
- Use workspace tasks for builds (Ctrl+Shift+P > Tasks: Run Task)
- After modifying `.Build.cs`, regenerate project files

## Best Practices
- Always consider Blueprint compatibility when creating C++ classes
- Document complex code with comments
- Use Blueprints for rapid prototyping, C++ for critical performance
- Test changes in different build configurations when relevant
- Keep minimal dependencies in `.Build.cs` for faster builds

## Communication
- Always respond in Brazilian Portuguese when user speaks in Portuguese
- Explain the reason for suggested changes
- Consider impact on existing Blueprints when modifying C++ code
- When suggesting changes, always mention if rebuild is required
