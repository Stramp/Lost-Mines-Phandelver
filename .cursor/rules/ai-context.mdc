# AI Context

## Project Information
- **Name**: MyProject2
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.7
- **Platform**: Windows (Win64)
- **Language**: C++ and Blueprints
- **Structure**: Standard Unreal Engine project

## Important Directory Structure
- `Source/MyProject2/` - Main C++ code
- `Content/` - Assets (Blueprints, Textures, Models)
- `Config/` - Configuration files (.ini)
- `.cursor/rules/` - Cursor rules for the project

## Project Conventions
- Use rules in `.cursor/rules/` as reference
- **CRITICAL:** ALWAYS follow Clean Code and Design Patterns (see `clean-code-mandatory.mdc`)
- **CRITICAL:** ALWAYS stop execution if request conflicts with architecture or code quality (see `execution-guard.mdc`)
- **ALWAYS** use Conventional Commits format (see `git-commits.mdc`)
- **ALWAYS** write tests for helper functions (see `testing.mdc`)
- **ALWAYS** maintain expert/teacher posture in C++/Unreal (see `teaching-role.mdc`)
- **ALWAYS** use collapsible sections in Markdown files (see `markdown-organization.mdc`)
- Always follow Unreal Engine standards
- Document complex code
- Keep code clean and organized

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - MAXIMUM PRIORITY ⚠️
- **ALWAYS** apply Clean Code and Design Patterns in ALL situations
- **NEVER** create "temporary" or "just for testing" code that violates these rules
- **ALWAYS** place reusable helper functions in `Utils/` or `Helpers/`
- See complete rule at: `.cursor/rules/clean-code-mandatory.mdc`

## When Suggesting Changes
- **ALWAYS** explain the reason
- **ALWAYS** consider impact on Blueprints
- **ALWAYS** verify it compiles before suggesting
- **ALWAYS** mention if rebuild is required

## File Context
- When working with files, consider:
  - Project structure
  - Established patterns
  - Blueprint compatibility
  - Performance (especially in hot paths)

## Communication
- Always respond in Brazilian Portuguese
- Be clear and direct
- Provide examples when useful
- Explain complex concepts
